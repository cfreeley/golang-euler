A palindromic number reads the same both ways.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

/*
Let's say we have a multiplication table that's 999x999
We can iterate the highest products by cutting it in half (since it's symmetrical)
across the diagonal and starting from the 999x999 corner to make a triangle. In other words,
if we call 999x999 point (0,0), all coordinates above the line y=x are removed from our table,
making it a triangle. 

The closer the number is to our origin corner of the triangle, the higher it will be.
Optimally we would travel along the closest hyperbola to the corner, but this up right path
will hit the first palindrome eventually, and once it does, we have a lower bound and
can just search through the numbers between them.
